                  <p>Since creating this map, we've recieved a lot of emails from teachers at all levels asking if they can use the map in teaching their students. Of course we would love for people to spread the map around more, but there are some very important things to take into account when using this map.</p>
                  <p><strong>First of all, this map must be used critically. Maps function as colonial artifacts and represent a very particular way of seeing the world - a way primarily concerned with ownership, exclusivity, and power relations.</strong></p>
                  <p>There are a ton of issues when it comes to using a map like this. And if people do not take these things into account, the map may prove more harmful than valuable.</p>

                  <h2>Historical Primer</h2>
                  <p><i>Shauna Johnson, UBC</i></p>
                    <p>In Canada and the United States, there is a long, dire
                    history of colonization that has impacted indigenous peoples in many ways.
                    While history books highlight famous white explorers and celebrated major
                    events such as the discovery of ‘New Lands’, keep in mind that narratives told
                    in the text books tell one side of the story; the story that the Europeans, as
                    the all ‘superior humans’ chose to put in the history books (King, 2012). </p>
                    <p>When we talk about history, we talk about stories of the past.
                    These stories have been organized into agreed upon events and interpretations
                    that tell how “we” got from here to there. The problem with this is that those
                    who held the most power chose the stories that were to become a part of
                    history. History is a tool to tell stories about how they became powerful and
                    how the powerful use that power to remain in power. So when it comes to the
                    oral histories of indigenous peoples, many of the narratives were discounted,
                    ignored, and erased from history by altering or not acknowledging the accounts
                    of indigenous peoples (Smith, 2012) (King, 2012). </p>
                    <p>One reason behind this may originate back to the Papal Bulls
                    of discovery, a doctrine in the 15<sup>th</sup> century that granted catholic
                    explorers full authority to convert, subjugate, remediate, and forcefully
                    remove indigenous peoples from their land. If they refused, they were
                    authorized to enslave and kill them as a way to save their souls (Miller et al,
                    2010). It was the belief that those who embraced Christianity were more human
                    or superior beings than those who didn’t, and thus incapable of having their
                    own legal, economic or political institutions to govern themselves. In short
                    indigenous peoples were lesser humans, and therefore had inferior
                    relationships/rights to land. This belief provided a foundation in which
                    imperial laws were established, rationalizing and legitimizing and imperial
                    assumption of power over indigenous lands and resources. Indigenous (as well as
                    other systems of knowledge) were dismissed. Instead, western systems of
                    knowledge were positioned as being superior and trumping all others (Smith,
                    2012). </p>
                    <p>Conceptualization of space is only one tool that was used to
                    create three basic entities on paper to help shape and redefine the indigenous
                    perspective of space: The line, centre and the outside. The line was used to
                    create boundaries, map territories, to survey land and create properties, and
                    to mark the limit of colonial powers. The centre was always focused on the
                    colonial power, with everything else being oriented in relation to it. Everything
                    outside the limits of power was considered irrelevant or non-existent (Smith,
                    2012).</p>
                    <p>The concept of mapping has had a tremendous impact upon
                    indigenous peoples for centuries. Since it was first developed, the indigenous ways
                    of orienting themselves on their lands were redefined. As soon as lines were
                    drawn on maps by European hands, indigenous place names, which are intricately
                    connected with indigenous history, stories, and teachings, were replaced with
                    English names, erasing indigenous presence from the lands. Traditional homelands
                    were divided and classified into different geographic features, properties and
                    imperial nations states, dividing and separating indigenous families. Languages
                    and cultural teachings were lost as children were forced to attend residential
                    schools and learn western ways of knowing. </p>
